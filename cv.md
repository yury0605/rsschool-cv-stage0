### About me
Hello! I am very glad to see you in my CV. 
So, that is my strengths. Diligence is my second name. I work about 12-14 hours a day to get progress. I keep attention on job always. I think, every specialist should like his job as well to be a good at it.
I have great soft skills because i worked with people a lot. I do not get annoying for people, and at the same time i do a good job in communicating with people.
Well, i am very responsible. You can trust me to work, and be sure i will make efforts to do it.
